### RMarkdown sources of paper "Model prediction for in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19: a case-control study in Isfahan, Iran"

The RMarkdown source code of this repository corresponds to the gradient boosting model exploration perform for the paper "Model prediction for in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19: a case-control study in Isfahan, Iran"

The model included in the paper use the **MixModel** variables (`PT`, `Neutrophilspercent`, `lymphocytespercent`, `CatHaematocrit`, `Age`, `CRP`, `Respiratorydistress1`, `ASTALTRatio`, `APTT` and `BloodUreaNitrogen`) using an oversampling technique to balance classes. Validation results are available in [the Undersampling/Oversampling dashboard](https://github.com/IACS-Biocomputing/isfahan_covid19_analysis/blob/main/covid19_undersampling_oversampling_tests.html).
